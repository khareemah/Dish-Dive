# Dish Dive Application

## Problem Statement

In Nigeria, and most parts of Africa, a lot of focus is placed on food ordering but none on Food Discovery. The platforms that exist, don't place emphasis on the food items but the entities selling them.
An example, on services like Glovo, ChowDeck, you see "The Place" has a rating of 4.5, and "Foodies" a rating of 4.8 BUT how does this trickle down to the plethora of items the two restaurants sell?
How can a person identify who sells the best jollof rice or fried rice or spiced beef, what are people saying about these items? OR even, get to see all restaurants selling Jollof rice, and compare their prices?
This - among other pain points - does not exist today. Attached is a screenshot of a real life twitter conversation around this.

Your task:
Design the mobile landing or home view of what an app designed to solve this problem will look like. You are allowed to research, extend and flesh out the context above as you see fit.
